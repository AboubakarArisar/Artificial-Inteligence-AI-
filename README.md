## 📚 **About the Course**
Artificial Intelligence (AI) focuses on building systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. The lab complements the theory by providing hands-on experience with:
- Implementing AI algorithms.
- Solving real-world problems using AI techniques.
- Exploring concepts like search strategies, game playing, knowledge representation, and more.

## 🛠️ **Technologies and Tools**
- **Programming Language**: Python 🐍
- **Libraries**: 
  - NumPy
  - Pandas
  - Matplotlib
  - Scikit-learn
  - TensorFlow / PyTorch (if applicable)
- **Development Tools**: Jupyter Notebook, VS Code
